The following are required to build the bindings:
1. Python 2.3* or higher (http://www.python.org/)
2. Cython 0.14.1** or higher (http://cython.org/)

* Not tested with Python versions other than 2.6
** Not tested with Cython versions other than 0.14.1


1a. BUILDING WITH Visual Studio (Windows)

   $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace


1b. BUILDING WITH MINGW (Windows)

   $ python setup.py build_ext -c mingw32 --inplace


1c. BUILDING WITH GCC/G++ (Linux, OS X, etc.)

   $ python setup.py build_ext --inplace


2. INSTALLATION

NOTE: This is a bit of a workaround, setup.py still needs some work...

First create a build\lib.<your platform> directory (e.g build\lib.win32-2.7), and copy the ode.pyd file into it, then run:
   $ python setup.py install --skip-build
