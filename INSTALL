the configuration process is not currently automated. currently only linux
and MS-windows (using VC++, GCC-MinGW or Cygwin) have been verified to work.
you will need GNU make 3.78.1 or later.

step 1
------

copy build/Makefile.config.example to build/Makefile.config

edit the settings in the following files to match your platform

	* build/Makefile.config
	* include/ode/config.h


step 2
------

from the top level directory, type `make'. this will hopefully build all
libraries and test applications.
