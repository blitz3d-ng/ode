
 Due to the wide variety of platforms, environments, and tools used 
 by the ODE community, solutions for specific tools are not included
 with the source code. Instead, a tool called Premake is used to
 generate appropriately configured files for your toolset and project.
 
 For more information and instructions, see the ODE User Manual, and
 the "Install and Use" page in particular.
