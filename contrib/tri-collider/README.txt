Trianglecollider by Erwin de Vries (erwin@vo.com) for use with ODE 0.03
(and hopefully up) and Win32 using MSVC6.

This library allows you to do triangle-sphere and triangle-box collisions.
The intersecting triangles are generated by OPCODE.
In the end the actual contacts are generated by doing a plane-primitve test.
This is far from correct of course, but it appears to work in the general case.

Things you need to do to get it working:
- Download and compile OPCODE v1.0 (http://www.codercorner.com/Opcode.htm).
- Include ODE's 'array.h' and all external includes.
- Modify ODE's dCollideBP in geom.cpp to remove this line: "dIASSERT (o2->_class->num == dPlaneClass);"

Possile future improvements:
- Migrate to a higher OPCODE version for major speedups, and more features.
- Add support for ODE's capped cylinder primitve and convex hulls.
- Add support for other platforms.

If you have problems, bugs, fixes, addons, or anything related let me know.

Some quick notes:
- Dont use doubles.
- Compile Opcode and this source in seperate libs.
