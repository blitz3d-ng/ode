    I spent quite some time to decouple it from our higher level API, and
    move it into a seperate library. It still uses some of our engine stuff,
    but its very minimal. Its C++ only for now.

    The implemented callback functions are required for our application.
    They both have a good reason of existence.

    You need to download Opcode from http://www.codercorner.com/Opcode.htm.
    I just noticed v1.1 was released. I used v1.0 so i suggest you download
    that one as well.
